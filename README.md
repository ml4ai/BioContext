# Inferring Biological Context from Text
This repository is the homepage for all data and code associated with the UA Big Mechanism projects biological context branch. The main goal of this project is to correctly link biological events and biological context containers that have been extracted from Biomedical publications.

## Obtaining our code and data
- The code for our project is available in the [experimentation repository](https://github.com/ml4ai/BioContext_experiment). This repository includes all the documentation necessary to replicate our published findings from our [DMBIH](http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/research/vc/ICDM18/index.html) workshop paper submission (in coordination with [ICDM](http://icdm2018.org/workshop/)).
- For replication of results associated with our ablation study we have made our [ablation data](https://github.com/ml4ai/BioContext_results) available as well, so that those without the computational resources to conduct an ablation study can still replicate our additional results.
