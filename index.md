# Inferring Biological Context from Text
This repository is the homepage for all data and code associated with the UA Big Mechanism projects biological context project. 

The main goal of this project is to correctly link biological events and biological context containers that have been extracted from Biomedical publications.


## Obtaining our code and data
- The code for our project is available in the [experimentation repository](https://github.com/ml4ai/BioContext_experiment). This repository includes all the documentation necessary to replicate our published findings from our [DMBIH](http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/research/vc/ICDM18/index.html) workshop paper submission (in coordination with [ICDM](http://icdm2018.org/workshop/)).

- The annotations used for the experiment are available in the [corpus repository](https://github.com/ml4ai/BioContext_corpus). This repository contains the information extraction annotations, the domain expert annotations in a format ready to be consumed by the code of the experimentation repository.

- For replication of results associated with our ablation study we have made our [ablation data](https://github.com/ml4ai/BioContext_results) available as well, so that those without the computational resources to conduct an ablation study can still replicate our additional results.

## Dataset description
We obtained our corpus of Biomedical papers from PubMed Central. Below is a table of the PMCIDs for each of our 22 papers along with the paper titles. The PMCIDs can be used to find the original papers that are available on PubMed.
